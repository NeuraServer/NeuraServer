# NeuraServer

NeuraServer is an advanced TCP server that demonstrates the integration of Go for speed-critical components, Rust for main server logic, and C++ for monitoring and terminal operations. This project showcases how to leverage the strengths of different programming languages within a single application.

## Overview

NeuraServer is designed to handle high-performance network operations with the robustness of Rust, the efficiency of Go, and the monitoring capabilities of C++ for critical terminal operations.

## Features

- High-performance network operations
- Robustness with Rust
- Efficiency with Go
- Monitoring and terminal operations with C++
- Big Data Processing with Apache Hadoop
- Data Streaming with Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, and Apache Zookeeper
- Data Warehousing with Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake
- Data Lakes with Apache Hadoop and Amazon S3
- Machine Learning and AI with TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Graph Databases with Neo4j and Amazon Neptune
- Data Virtualization with Denodo
- Data Security and Privacy
- Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology
- Data Governance and Metadata Management
- Kubernetes orchestration for deployment, service discovery, and autoscaling
- Data analysis and real-time processing with Apache Arrow

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [GCC/MINGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NeuraServer/NeuraServer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd NeuraServer
    ```

3. Build and run the server:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    go build -o handler src/server/handler.go
    go build -o logger src/server/logger.go
    g++ src/serverasm/mod.cpp -o src/serverasm/mod.exe
    ```

## Usage

### Running with Docker

The Docker configuration files are located in the `.docker` directory.

1. Navigate to the Docker directory:

    ```sh
    cd .docker
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker-compose build
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

The server will be accessible on `127.0.0.1:8080`. You can connect to it using a TCP client.

### Running on Kubernetes

The Kubernetes configuration files are located in the `orchestration` directory.

1. Deploy the application:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f orchestration/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f orchestration/service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f orchestration/ingress.yaml
    kubectl apply -f orchestration/autoscaler.yaml
    ```

2. Verify the deployment:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get svc
    kubectl get ing
    kubectl get hpa
    ```

## Development

To ensure code quality and consistency, use the following commands during development:

- Build the project:

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

- Run the project:

    ```sh
    make run
    ```

- Clean the project:

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

- Format the source code:

    ```sh
    make fmt
    ```

- Lint the source code:

    ```sh
    make lint
    ```
