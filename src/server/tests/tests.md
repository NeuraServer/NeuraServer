# How tests work
These tests simulate data, how the server would process it in strings, evaluating simulated data.
This is used for non-downtime testing and deployment, and "Dummy data" usage to prevent data breaches.
These tests can be manually assined data, or import real data (Which can be risky) to the string or a csv format.
